# gardening-idle

A prototype idle/clicker game about gardening and permaculture.

## Status (2020 Q1)

This project is under development in a private repo while I build up my Vue skills and prototype things. If you're interested in collaborating, let me know.

The stack will be Vue + who knows what else, and plain Node.js+PostgreSQL for server side parts, hosted in a Kubernetes cluster of my own.
